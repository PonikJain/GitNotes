Git Commands  : Tutorial link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyAAIHHClqI

1. To check how many branch are available :     git branch

2. To crate new branch  :  git branch <branch_name>

3. To move to the another branch /or checkout the branch: git checkout <branch_name>

4. To check the GIT head pointer : git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

5. Create a alias for command for for short : alias graph="git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
"
So by just writing the graph we can see the status of HEAD pointer

6.To check diff between two branches : git diff <first_branch>..<second_branch>

7. Merging branch : for that we need to move to the branch where we want to merge and then run the following command
        git merge <branch_name_which_we_want_to_merge>
        
 8. Checked the merged branch : git branch --merged
 
 9. DELETE THE BEANCH AFTER MERGING :  git branch -d <branch_name>
 if you want to do it forcefully without merging : git branch -D <branch_name>
 
 10. Shortcut commad to create and checkout the branch  : git checkout -b <branch_name>
 
 ------------------------------------------------------
 
 Stash : IF we are working on a branch and we want to switch to another without committing the changes then we can 
 stash them to that state so that we can later on access those changes and continue to work on that.
 
 command to stash : git stash 
 
 to check the stashed file list : git stash list
 
 to apply the stached file changes again : git stash apply
