Git Commands  : Tutorial link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyAAIHHClqI

1. To check how many branch are available :     git branch

2. To crate new branch  :  git branch <branch_name>

3. To move to the another branch /or checkout the branch: git checkout <branch_name>

4. To check the GIT head pointer : git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

5. Create a alias for command for for short : alias graph="git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph
"
So by just writing the graph we can see the status of HEAD pointer

6.To check diff between two branches : git diff <first_branch>..<second_branch>

7. Merging branch : for that we need to move to the branch where we want to merge and then run the following command
        git merge <branch_name_which_we_want_to_merge>
        
 8. Checked the merged branch : git branch --merged
 
 9. DELETE THE BEANCH AFTER MERGING :  git branch -d <branch_name>
 if you want to do it forcefully without merging : git branch -D <branch_name>
